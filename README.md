Iterator utility for counting the number of iterations with an arbitrary
type that implements the `Step` trait.

Note that this library is unstable, as it depends on an unstable Rust feature,
and requires nightly Rust to compile.

To use, import individual functions (listed in the documentation)
or `use discard_while::DiscardWhile` to get the convenience trait that allows
calling these functions as methods.
